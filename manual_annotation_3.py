    Method to manually annotate characters, bounding boxes for characters and background colour.
    How to annotate:
        1. Mark bounding boxes of characters, left to right
        2. Press 'n' to move onto text annotation
        3. Input character numbers as they appear left to right in the comic, separated by a space
        4. Put a comma in between the characters and the background colour,
            input background colour as abbreviated letter (see printed options)

    N.B. Order is important, annotate left to right for bounding boxes and characters.
        If there is no character, don't input a bounding box.
